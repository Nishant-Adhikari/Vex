/**
 * Non-destructive project recreation — issue #26. After a Docker Desktop
 * restart the daemon can reference a wiped bind-mount cache hash, so
 * `up -d` fails with "no such file or directory" (`STALE_BIND_MOUNT_RE` in
 * `stale-secret-recovery.ts`). That module's wipe (`down --volumes` +
 * regenerated password + reset install state) is destructive and gated to
 * PRE-SETUP only. This module is the POST-SETUP-safe alternative: recreating
 * the containers forces Docker Desktop to rebuild the bind-mount cache for
 * the UNCHANGED secret file, so `pg_authid` still matches and nothing is
 * lost — never pass `--volumes` here, and never touch the secret file.
