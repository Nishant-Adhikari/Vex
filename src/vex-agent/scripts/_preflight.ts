/**
 * Shared pre-flight checks for maintenance scripts.
 *
 * These guards exist because the maintenance commands (knowledge-export,
 * knowledge-import, knowledge-reembed) operate on production data and a
 * wrong-DB or stale-schema run is essentially data loss. The runtime path
 * (desktop app, internal tools) keeps using getPool() with the dev fallback
 * for backwards compatibility — that's a separate audit item, not in scope
 * here. Maintenance scripts MUST be stricter than runtime.
 *
 * Two checks:
 *   1. assertExplicitDbUrl — VEX_DB_URL must be set (no silent fallback
 *      to vex_test). Operators backing up the wrong DB is a real
 *      data-loss scenario.
 *   2. assertSchemaUpToDate — knowledge_entries.supersedes_id column must
 *      exist (added by 006_knowledge_lifecycle.sql). migrate.ts is strictly
 *      forward-only, so this column is the canary for "runMigrations has been
 *      run against this volume on a build that includes 006". We check the
 *      most recently added column rather than an old one so future migrations
 *      can just update the canary instead of rewriting the guard logic.
